Amazon Product Review Analysis

## Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon product reviews to understand how customers rate products, what categories perform best, and how the number of reviews affects sales. The goal is to help RetailTech Insight make better product and marketing decisions based on real customer feedback.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard)

## Files and Folders

- `Data/` – Raw and cleaned data files
- `Excel Dashboard/` – Contains the main dashboard file
  
- `Visualizations/` – Saved charts and graphs
- `README.md` – This documentation filed

## What I Did

1. Cleaned the data – I removed duplicates, fixed missing values, and corrected inconsistent category names.
2. Analyzed product ratings – I checked which categories had the highest and lowest ratings.
3. Checked review counts – I compared the number of reviews with the average ratings and prices.
4. Created dashboards– I used Excel visuals for easier understanding.


## Key Findings
- Electronics, Computer&Accessories, Home&Kitchen, Office Products, Home Improvement are the top five products.
- BoAt was the Product with the highest rating.
- Sixteen products had less than 10,000 reviews.


## What I Recommend
- Review low-rated items in popular categories.
- Encourage more verified buyers to leave honest reviews.
- Promote top-rated products in ads or special deals.
- Consider pricing adjustments for items with poor reviews.
