Amazon Product Review Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Amazon product reviews to understand how customers rate products, what categories perform best, and how the number of reviews affects sales. The goal is to help RetailTech Insight understand what drives highh product rating and how review data can influence decision-making in marketing and product development.

## Data Source
- The data for this project was gotten form Digital SkillUp Africa(DSA) Learning Management System as part of my final Project

## Files and Folders

- `Data/` – Raw and cleaned data files
- `Excel Dashboard/` – Contains the main dashboard file
  
- `Visualizations/` – Saved charts
- `README.md` – This documentation filed

## What I Did

1. Cleaned the data – I removed duplicates, fixed missing values, and corrected inconsistent category names.
2. Analyzed product ratings – I checked which categories had the highest and lowest ratings.
3. Checked review counts – I compared the number of reviews with the average ratings and prices.
4. Created dashboards– I used Excel visuals for easier understanding.




## Key Findings
